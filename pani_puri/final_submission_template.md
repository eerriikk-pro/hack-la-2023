# Reflection
## Approach
> What was your approach to the dataset? What problem did you want to solve? What technology did you decide to use? How did your team split the work?

We wanted to first do data analysis, then provide some unique solutions. We noticed that students are working very late, and wanted to provide a solution to help students work faster. Everyone's using ChatGPT nowdays, but what if we could make it better?

And thus, we created CourseCompanion, a chatbot able to pull context from your course content to better help you through your learning!

We want to thank the creaters of:
[Canvas File Downloader GitHub](https://github.com/benjavicente/canvas-file-downloader/blob/master/readme.md), as we used this module to speedup scraping files from our canvas courses.
